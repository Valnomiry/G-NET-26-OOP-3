            #region Part 01 : Theoretical Questions

            //Q1 : Identify the type of relationship in each scenario below (Inheritance, Association, Aggregation, Composition, or Dependency):

            //a) A University has Departments. If the university is closed, the departments no longer exist.
            //answer : Composition

            //b) A Driver uses a Car. The driver does not own the car.
            //answer : Association

            //c) A Dog is an Animal.
            //answer : Inheritance

            //d) A Team has Players. If the team is deleted, the players still exist.
            //answer : Aggregation

            //e) A method receives a Logger as a parameter and calls it inside the method only.
            //answer : Dependency




            //Q2 : Answer the following questions about access modifiers and sealed:

            //a) A parent class has a protected field. Can a child class in a different assembly access it? What about through an object instance from outside?
            //answer : No, a child class in a different assembly cannot access a protected field. However, it can access it through an object instance from outside.

            //b) What is the difference between protected internal and private protected?
            //answer : Protected internal allows access to members from derived classes and classes within the same assembly, while private protected allows access only to derived classes within the same assembly.

            //c) What does the sealed keyword do when applied to a class? What about when applied to a method?
            //answer : When applied to a class, the sealed keyword prevents other classes from inheriting from it. When applied to a method, it prevents derived classes from overriding that method.


            //d) Can you create an object from a sealed class using new? Why or why not?
            //answer : Yes, you can create an object from a sealed class using new. The sealed keyword only prevents inheritance, but it does not prevent instantiation of the class.
